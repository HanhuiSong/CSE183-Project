##Description:
Our group project is a website for users to share and find used cars. It’s just like the simple version of the “Carfax” 
website, and we did use it as a good example in our project. 

##Functionality:

- Main page:
	The first page of our website. When the user login with their account, they can visit this page. 

- Second Page:
	- Users can use the filter function to find the car they like on this page. 
	- Users can click on the more detailed button to see more information about a particular car. 
	- Users can also bookmark the car they like. 

- More Detail Page:
	This page shows more information about a particular car. 

- Bookmarks Page：
	This page shows the cars that the user bookmarked, and users also can delete any bookmark they made before. 

- Post Car Page：
	The users can post the car they want to sell on this page, and they can also edit any information about the vehicle 
	they already posted. 

- Feedback Page：
	Users can post their comments for our website here on this page. 

##How to Test It:
You could download our main repository as a “zip” file; You should get another file called “cse183project-main” if you 
extract it. Then you could go into that file, select all the files and compress them again. In the end, you could simply 
use “py4web” to add this new compressed file as a new application and open it throughout the “py4web”.
